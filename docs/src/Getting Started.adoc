= STMBL Getting Started Guide

== Description

STMBL is a motor drive controlled by the STM32 microprocessor. It can 
power motors of up to 2.2kW and up to around 350V DC bus voltage. 

The name "STMBL" is based on the combination of the STM32 microprocessor
and BrushLess motor. However the drive is also capable of powering AC
induction motors. The hardware is also capable of driving 3-phase
stepper motors.

The drive is configurable for a wide range of command and feedback types
through a HAL layer analagous to that used by 
http://linuxcnc.org/docs/2.7/html/hal/intro.html[LinuxCNC]. 

Supported command interfaces are:

* Mesa Smart-Serial
* Step-Dir
* Quadrature
* Serial

+/-10V control is not supported, though the hardware capability exists.

Supported feedback interfaces are:

* Encoder
* Resolver
* sin/cos 1vpp
* Mitsubishi absolute encoder
* Yaskawa absolute encoder
* Sick Hyperface
* Sanyo Denki absolute encoder

Encoder power is 5V by default but 12V can be selected by jumper pads on
the PCB. 

In addition to motor control and feedback each STMBL drive has two
+/-30V analogue inputs and three 24V / 2A digital outputs. 

== Anatomy of the STMBL

The STMBL consists of two separate PCBs (though they are made as one,
assembled and then split to be connected in the manner shown below. 
The vertical (top) board is the Low Voltage (LV) board and this handles
the command, feedback and configuration tasks. The STM32F4
microprocessor is in charge of these tasks. 
The lower board is the
high-voltage (HV) board and this is where the power driver is situated.
The only connection between the two boards is a serial connection
through a 5kV isolation IC. To make this possible there is a second
STM32 chip on the lower board. This is an STM32F3 and is referred to as
the "F3" in the remainder of this document. The processor on the upper
board is referred to as "F4".

The connectors on the HV board are 5.08mm pitch. Those on the LV board
are 3.5mm pitch.  Mating part numbers are:

* HV Power: https://octopart.com/1757019-phoenix+contact-789[1757019]
* HV Motor: https://octopart.com/1757022-phoenix+contact-902[1757022] or
https://octopart.com/1792760-phoenix+contact-29279[1792760]
* LV Power: https://octopart.com/1840366-phoenix+contact-6675[1840366] or
https://octopart.com/1862852-phoenix+contact-118535[1862852]
* IO: https://octopart.com/1840405-phoenix+contact-14126[1840405] or
https://octopart.com/1862894-phoenix+contact-79205[1862894]

If preferred 2 x 3 position or 3 x 2 position plugs can be inserted in
the 6-position sockets. 

Logic power to the LV board should be 24V. A green LED will light
adjacent to the socket when power is supplied.

WARNING: The LV board is safe up to about 30V but take care that 0V is
common with the PC GND before connecting a USB cable. 

Motor power should be 30 to 350V, though the logic parts of the HV
board may work at 24V for firmware flashing etc. Again a green LED
adjacent to the connector confirms that the board is powered-up.

WARNING: The HV and LV boards are isolated in normal use but it is easy
to accidentally connect them. One way to do this is via USB cables which
can easily tie GND lines together through the setup PC. It is imperative
that the HV board should be powered from an isolated (and preferably
low voltage) supply when flashing firmware. 

image::images/ISO2.svg[]

The command and feedback connectors use standard 8P8C (RJ45) connectors
and standard CAT5 or CAT6 cables can be conveniently used. To connect
to cables with larger conductors than supported by CAT5 it is possible
to use, for example,
https://octopart.com/j00026a2001-teleg√§rtner-24873031[Industrial CAT6a]
connectors which can accept core wires up to 1.6mm and overall cable
diameters up to 9.0mm.

Feedback 0 will typically be the encoder or resolver mounted on the
motor and feedback 1 can be used to connect either Hall sensors for
initial commutation or (potentially) scales mounted directly to the
axes. See the <<Pinouts>> section of this document for pin assigments
and typical wiring colour codes. 

The 6-way socket below the 24V logic power connector contains the three
digital outputs. These are current-sinking (switch-to-GND) and each is
adjacent to a 24V suppply pin. DIO0 (nearest the top) is the one that is
typically used to operate the holding brake on motors so-equipped. 

On the top of the drive are two analogue inputs, with 0V and 24V on
either side to that a potentiometer can be connected. These are
typically used as variable-threshold digital inputs and are used, for
example, for axis limit switches. However it is relatively simple to
configure them for other uses in the HAL layer. 

Three LEDS on top of the unit indicate drive status. Red displays error
codes (using <<Blink Codes,blink codes>>). Amber indicates that all is well but the
drive is not enabled, and green shows that the drive is active and
operating normally. 

If no LEDs on the top of the board are illuminated, and the green power
LEDs near the power connectors _are_ illuminated then it is probably
necessary to <<Flashing Firmware, flash the firmware>>. If there are
LEDs lit on top of the drive then it is probably safe to assume that
firmware is loaded. 

== HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)

STMBL uses a Hardware abstraction layer to configure the drive for
different types of motor, feedback and operation mode.
This is conceptually similar to the HAL in LinuxCNC but the format and
cmmands are different. Also, all pins are floating point so no data
conversion is needed. 

An Application called <<Servoterm>> is used to interact with the HAL
interface and configure the drive. You will need to install and launch
this before it is possible to configure the STMBL.

STMBL HAL configuration does not use any commands other than the = sign
and the <<Servoterm Commands,servoterm commands>>

Assuming that there is already a motor connected to the drive and that
the drive it powered up the <<Servoterm>> display should already be
indicating the motor position feedback. Rotating the motor shaft by hand
might produce something like:

image::images/servoterm3.png[]

Though it equally well might not if the configuration is set up for a
resolver and the motor has an encoder. 

It should be possible to make the motor turn at this point without any
further configuration. The commands that follow will set the hv0 module
up to simply rotate the motor open-loop in direct-mode. (like a stepper
motor) with an excitation current of 0.5A. This should be safe for most
motors that the STMBL is a good match for, but you should choose your
own value. For an explanation of direct and quadrature current see the
section on <<Motor Basics#,motor control basics>>

`hv0.pos = sim0.vel`
`hv0.d_cmd = 0.5`
`hv0.en = 1`

The rotation speed can be altered by changing the sim0 frequency:

`sim0.freq = 5`

STMBL v4 HAL contains a number of components that have built-in linking
behaviour. 


=== HAL modules
The Servoterm command `show` will list all the HAL modules that can be
loaded (whereas `list` will show all those that currently are loaded)

The modules available are as follows (the link will take you to the

== Servoterm

Servoterm (servo terminal) provides an interface which allows editing
of the drive HAL configuration. It also provides a rolling graphical
representation of any chosen parameter in the HAL which can be a great
aid to tuning and motor setup. 

Servoterm is supplied as a Google Chrome Add-in. This might seem
somewhat odd, but does provide for good cross-platform availability. 

Servoterm can be downloaded from https://github.com/STMBL/Servoterm-app[
this link].
Use the green button to download as a ZIP file and then extract on your
PC (Linux / Mac / PC). Open Google Chrome and click the three-dots icon
-> more-tools -> extensions.

[width=600, border]
image::images/Extensions.png[]

Click
"developer mode" and then "Load Unpacked Extension". Then navigate to
the downloaded files and select the "Servoterm" folder. 
You should then be presented with the following, including an option to
launch the application.

[width=600]

image::images/Extensions2.png[]

To connect to the STMBL you will need a mini-USB B cable.

WARNING:Be sure that the 24V PSU is floating or shares a ground
reference with the PC.(Maybe even check the voltage between the
connector and socket before inserting the plug)

You can then click the "connect" button and you should get something
like the image below. <<Servoterm Connection Problems, what if I can
not connect>>

image::images/servoterm1.png[]

Taking the buttons from left to right:

* Connect / Disconnect - Should be fairly self-evident
* Clear - simply clears the screen
* Reset - Resets the connection. Does not reset the STMBL. To do that
type the <<Servoterm Commands,`reset`>> command
* Capture - Allows the output of the graphs to be saved and exported to
file
* Jog - when ticked the left-right arrow keys on the keyboard can be
used to jog the motor. 
* Trigger - stops the graph plot until the trigger condition is met.
* Trigger Status Indicator - not a button
* Edit Config - Brings up a sub-window in which the basic system config
can be edited. 

Other than the buttons described above the ramainder of servoterm (and
the STMBL HAL) is controlled by a command-line interface. 

Servoterm uses the up and down arrow keys to scroll through previous
commands, but there is no tab-completion. 

This is mainly described in the <<HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer),HAL>>
section of this document. 
The graphing display is controlled by the "term0" interface. Typing
`term0` at the prompt will show output similar to:

image::images/servoterm2.png[]

The first two entries are internal information about the HAL component
and can be ignored for now.
The next 8 lines say what internal signal each of the wave plots is
connected to. In this case wave0 (the black one) is connected to a sim
signal, in this case the sine wave. (as you might have guessed, typing 
"sim0" will show you the parameters of the simulated signals.)

To connect wave1 (red) to the sawtooth output (which simulates both
encoder feedback and a position command for steady rotation) then simply
type
`term0.wave1 = sim0.vel`
Each wave has an associated offset and gain parameter that can be used
to adjust vertical scale and position. The `term0.send_step` parameter
functions like the time-base of an oscilloscope. 

=== Servoterm Commands

The servoterm command list can be obtained at the command line by using
the `help` command. 

* bootloader: enter bootloader
* reset: reset STMBL
* confcrc: Shows the CRC checksum of the loaded config. 
* flashloadconf: load config from flash

== Flashing Firmware

=== Requirements to build/flash firmware

The GCC cross-compiler for Arm:
gcc-arm-none-eabi-gcc https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download

In order for the STMBL Makefiles to be able to find the gcc binaries
you may need to edit the file toolchain.mak to point to the correct
folder and version number.

To flash the boards with USB you will need the dfu-utils package. 
http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net

stlink https://github.com/texane/stlink

You will also need the STMBL source code, available from
https://github.com/rene-dev/stmbl
You can either clone this as a https://git-scm.com[git] archive or just
download a current snapshot as a zip file. 

For Windows only you will also need the STMBL Virtual Comport
http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-utilities/stsw-stm32102.html

The STM32 chips have a built-in ROM bootloader, this means that it
should be impossible to "brick" the boards. Each of the two CPUs in the
STMBL drive needs both a dedicated bootloader to start the STMBL firmware
and the firmware itself. 

=== Checking for Existing Firmware

Before flashing firmware it is worth trying to figure out if your board
is completely blank or has been pre-flashed with a bootloader or
firmware. 
If the board lights any LEDs other than the green power-good ones near
to the power input connectors then there is likely to already be a
firmware installed. 

If the board is powered with 24V to the LV board and connected with USB
to a PC then it will report as "STMBL Virtual ComPort:" in the Apple
System Profiler, 
"ID 0483:5740 STMicroelectronics STM32F407" in lsusb in Linux and 
"STMBL Virtual COM Port" in the Windows device manager if
there is a full firmware + STM32 bootloader installed. 

Additionally, if the board will connect with Servoterm then it already
has a firmware and STMBL bootloader. 

If the board shows "STM32 BOOTLOADER" (Mac) 
"0483:df11 STMicroelectronics STM Device in DFU Mode" (Linus lsusb) or
"STM32 BOOTLOADER" (Windows Device Manager) when powered up (without
using the boot pads) then this indicates that it already has an STMBL
bootloader. (though no harm is done by re-flashing this)

If the LV board does not show up at all on the USB bus then attempt to
put it in ROM boot mode by shorting the boot pads together, you should
see "STM32 Bootlader" (Mac), "STMicroelectronics STM Device in DFU Mode"
(Linux lsusb) or "STM32 BOOTLOADER" (Windows Device Manager)
In this case you will need to flash both the STMBL bootloader and the
STMBL firmware. 

With 24V to the HV board and a USB connection: 

If the HV board has both an STMBL bootloader and an STMBL Firmware
installed then it will illuminate only the green power LED and will
 report as "STMBL Virtual Com Port" (Mac) 
"0483:5740 STMicroelectronics STM32F407" (Linux, rather inaccurately) 
and "Unknown Device" in the Windows Device Manager. 

If the HV board has an STMBL bootloader installed then it will flash a
red LED near to the USB connector and report as 
"STM32 DownLoad Firmware Update:" (Mac) 
"0483:df11 STMicroelectronics STM Device in DFU Mode" (Linux lsusb) and
"Unknown Device" in the Windows Device Manager. 

If the HV board does not show up at all on the USB bus then attempt to
put it in ROM boot mode by shorting the boot pads together, you should
see "STM32 Bootlader" (Mac), "STMicroelectronics STM Device in DFU Mode"
(Linux lsusb) or "STM32 BOOTLOADER" (Windows Device Manager)
In this case you will need to flash both the STMBL bootloader (F3
version) and the STMBL firmware (F3 version). 

The boards can also be flashed with a JTAG programmer, but that process
is not documented here. 

It can be convenient to flash the boards to test them before separating
the halves and before installing the IRAM module and bus capacitors if
you have a self-built or part-assembled board. 

It is possible that in the future standalone binaries of the firmware
will be made available. 

Firmware flashing is handled by specifying a makefile target for each of
the 4 firmware sections. 

=== Flashing the F4 (low voltage) board

Connect 24V to the low voltage board power cable and a USB cable to the
computer where the source code has been downloaded to.
To flash the initial boot formware it is necessary to put the STM32 CPU
into ROM bootloader mode. You do this by shorting together the two pads
marked "boot" on the larger of the two boards. For the exact location of
these pads see the illustration in the <<Anatomy of the STMBL,Anatomy>>
section. Typically a small screwdriver can be used for this purpose. 
At this point the board should appear as an "STM32 Bootloader" in the 
USB tree of the attached PC. It might be necessary to power-up the board
with the pads shorted. 

The commands to flash the firmwares should be issued from a command line
after navigating to the root of the downloaded source code (ie the same
directory as the "Makefile" file)

The command to flash the F4 bootloader is:

'make boot_btburn

There should then be a quantity of text output culminating with a
progress bar:

'Downloading to address = 0x08000000, size = 2756
'Download	[=========================] 100%         2756 bytes

There may be several apparent errors reported during the process, but
these can be ignored if the progress bar is seen.

The next step is to flash the actual firmware. This will take rather
longer as the firmware will need to be compiled. The command is:

'make btburn

Again, a progress bar should appear, indicating success. 

=== Flashing the F3 (high voltage board)

Connect an isolated 24V supply to the HV inputs of F3 board. The board
can operate at up to 380V but for the flashing process 24V is much safer.

Connect the USB cable to the HV board as with the LV board, and use the
boot pads on the HV board to put it into bootloader mode. Again it
should appear in the USB device tree. 

The command to flash the bootloader for the F3 board does not have a
makefile shortcut, it is:

'make -f f3dfu/Makefile btburn

Again a progress bar should be seen, after which the main F3 firmware
can be flashed:

'make f3_btburn

If all is well the board should now appear connnect to servoterm if the
USB cable is moved to the LV (F4) board and if 24V is supplied to both
power connectors.  

If you type "hv0" at the servoterm command line and see a bis voltage
then this indicates that both STM32 ships have working firmware and that
communication between them is functional. This might require as much as
30V supply to the F3 board as 24V is a little marginal for one of the
devices in the communication chain. 

Example:

'hv0


'hv0.max_cur <= conf0.max_ac_cur = 30.000000
'hv0.dc_volt = 33.513943
'hv0.d_fb = -0.022181
